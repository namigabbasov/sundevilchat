Search tips
In a Basic Search you'll receive results that contain all of your search terms. These may match keywords in a title, author names, subjects, abstract, or other descriptions.

Use the Advanced Search to pre-limit your search to specific fields, material types, or publication dates.

Use the Filters to limit to items available online or physically available in the library. You can also include or exclude particular material types, dates, authors, subjects, or library locations.

The * character can be used as a wildcard in place of one or more characters. [Examples: recycl*, organiz*, wom*n]

Enclosing your search in quotes " " will only return results with an exact match. [Examples: "global warming", "Affordable Care Act", "mutual funds"]

Searches can also be nested in ( ), combined with " " and Boolean operators AND, OR, NOT. [Example: "World War II" AND (sites OR battles) NOT (Normandy OR Pearl Harbor)]
